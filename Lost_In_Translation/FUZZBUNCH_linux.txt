Question: Why....?

Answer: Because I like challenges, and if all you are allowed on a Pentest is a Kali or ParrotOS CD, it is possible

NB: You will need a function X11 server, either locally or over the network to do this install.

## Step 1: Gather the required part of wine. Assuming Debian based OS as your host

sudo apt-get instal wine winbind

## Step 2: Run Wine's regedit to set up your PATH. You will thank me later for this...

snowden@nsa[~]$ wine regedit.exe

HKCU > Environment > New Key 
Name: PATH
Value c:\\windows;c:\\windows\\system;C:\\Python26;C:\\nsa\windows\\fuzzbunch

NB: This will take a while, as .wine will get set up

## Step 3: Create your directory structure. This actually isn't needed, but makes it lean. You can use Z: drive which wine maps to your home dir.

snowden@nsa[~]$ mkdir ~/.wine/drive_c/nsa

Step 4: Assuming your Wine install C:\nsa folder existed. copythe EQGRP windows folder from Lost_In_Translation there:

snowden@nsa[~]$ cp -R ~/EQGRP_Lost_in_Translation/windows/ ./nsa/

Step 5: install Python 2.6 inside wine (yeah, I know, 2017 right?):

snowden@nsa[~]$ wine msiexec /i python-2.6.msi

Step 6: Then pywin32 which is an EXE.

snowden@nsa[~]$ wine pywin32-219.win32-py2.6.exe

Step 7: Once this is all installed, execute a cmd.exe inside wine

snowden@nsa[~]$ wine cmd.exe
Wine CMD Version 5.1.2600 (1.6.2)

Step 8: Change to C: drive and fix the pywin32 installer

Z:\home\snowden\>c:
C:\>cd Python26\Scripts
C:\Python26>cd scripts

C:\Python26\Scripts> python pywin32_postinstall.py -install

Step 9: Fix the ListenPost folder and optionally copy my batch file in.

C:\Python26\Scripts> cd \nsa\windows

C:\nsa\windows> mkdir listeningposts

## Step 10

C:\nsa\windows> python fb.py
